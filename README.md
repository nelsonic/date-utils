rì
====

A few useful (unit tested) JavaScript date methods

### Background

A comprehensive introduction to the JavaScript Date (*built-in methods*)
is available on MDN:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date

### Existing JS Date Libaries

- Moment.js: http://momentjs.com/
- Date.js: http://www.datejs.com/
- Node Date Utils: https://github.com/JerrySievert/node-date-utils


### Why?

Why build *another* date utilities library when *several* already exist?

a) For fun. 
b) Coding (JS TDD) practice
c) Discovering interesting features
d) only build/load what I need (*minimalist*)

### Name (why call a date utilities library "ri"?)
rì is the chinese word for date or day of the month.

Right now this is just a working title till we come up with a better name...
I thought of using **T** or **D** but, T is taken by https://github.com/jasonmoo/t.js
and D.js is encumbered by "DJs". If you have a better name, please submit it! :-)
