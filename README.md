rì
====

A few useful (unit tested) JavaScript date methods


### Why?

Why build *another* date utilities library when *several* already exist?
(see list below)

- For fun. 
- Coding (JS TDD) practice
- Discover interesting features
- only build/load what I need (*minimalist*)

### Name (why call a date utilities library "ri"?)
rì is the chinese word for date or day of the month.

Right now this is just a working title till we come up with a better name...
I thought of using **T** or **D** but, T is taken by 
https://github.com/jasonmoo/t.js
and D.js is encumbered by "DJs". If you have a better name, please submit it!

In the interest of findability I'm considering changing the name of this repo
to something more keyword friendly... Words:

- Date, Utilities, Useful, Time, Helper

## Background / Researh

If you have never played with JavaScript **Date** try the
comprehensive introduction to the JavaScript Date (*built-in methods*)
