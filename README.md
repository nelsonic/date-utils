====

A few useful (unit tested) JavaScript date methods


### Why?

Why build *another* date utilities library when *several* already exist?
(see list below)

- For fun. 
- Coding (JS TDD) practice
- Discover interesting features
- only build/load what I need (*minimalist*)

## Name

**Date Uitls** is prety generic but tells people exactly what 
the script does.
